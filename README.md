# Micro-Reddit

In this project we set up models for user, post and comments for a micro-reddit application.
We implemented database structure with models and migrations, and active record validations.

## Built With

- RUBY
- RUBY ON RAILS

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

You need the following software programs in order to get a local copy:

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
- [Rails](http://railsinstaller.org/en)

### Setup

You can simply run the following command into own terminal to clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/martinnajjar12/micro-reddit`.

### Install

After you clone the repo, make sure you're in the root directory of the project. Now you should run `bundle install` to install all the required dependencies.

### Usage

- You can run the app into your terminal via the following command `rails console`.
- Now that the console is running, you can try to check all the users that are signed up in this project by running this command `User.all`.
- If you want, you can see all the posts of a user by typing `User.find(the user_id you want to see his posts).posts`.
- If you want to create a new user, you can simply type `User.create(username: REQUIRED, email: REQUIRED, password:REQUIRED`.

Try creating posts and comments in the same way.
